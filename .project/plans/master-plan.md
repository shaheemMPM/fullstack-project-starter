# Project Starter - Master Plan

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-29

## Vision

Create a comprehensive project starter template that eliminates setup time for hobby side projects. The template should be cloneable with easy customization of project names, package names, and configurations.

## Goals

1. Reduce project setup time from hours to minutes
2. Include common configurations and best practices
3. Support multiple project types (web apps, APIs, CLI tools, etc.)
4. Easy renaming/customization of project-specific identifiers
5. Include development tooling and CI/CD setup

## High-Level Milestones

- [ ] Phase 1: Project Management Setup
- [ ] Phase 2: Define Tech Stack & Architecture
- [ ] Phase 3: Core Project Structure
- [ ] Phase 4: Development Tooling Setup
- [ ] Phase 5: CI/CD & Deployment
- [ ] Phase 6: Documentation & Templates
- [ ] Phase 7: Testing & Validation

## Current Phase

**Phase 1: Project Management Setup** - Setting up tracking and planning infrastructure

## Notes

- User works on hobby projects after full-time software engineering job
- Main pain point: excessive time spent on initial setup
- Projects often abandoned before completion due to setup overhead
- This starter itself is a large undertaking - will track all tasks and plans
