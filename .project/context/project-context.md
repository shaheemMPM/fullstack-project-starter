**Last Updated:** 2025-10-29

## Project Overview

**Name:** project-starter
**Purpose:** Reusable template for quickly starting hobby side projects
**Owner:** Shaheem
**Primary Use:** Clone and customize for new projects instead of repeating setup work

## Key Requirements

1. **Easy Customization**

   - Simple renaming of project names
   - Package name replacements
   - Configuration updates

2. **Time Savings**

   - Eliminate repetitive setup tasks
   - Pre-configured development environment
   - Ready-to-use tooling

3. **Scalability**
   - Support different project types
   - Extensible architecture
   - Maintainable structure

## Important Constraints

- User has limited time (working on this after full-time job)
- Focus on practicality and perfection
- Should reduce friction, not add complexity

## Session Memory Reminders

- **ALWAYS** update `.project` files when taking on big sub-tasks
- Reference these files at the start of new sessions for context
- Keep task tracking up-to-date for continuity
- Document major decisions in `decisions/` directory

## Next Steps

Waiting for user input on:

- What types of projects to support (web, API, CLI, mobile, etc.)
- Preferred tech stack and languages
- Specific pain points in current setup process
- Must-have features and nice-to-haves
